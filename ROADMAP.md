# Roadmap: Astra Deck

Only incomplete, directly actionable work is kept here. Blocked work stays in `Roadmap_Blocked.md`; completed work belongs in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Requested

- [ ] P3 — Finish the 2026-09-28 audit sweep
  Why: the pass covered the watch-page monolith features it touched, background, popup, side
  panel, Subscription Groups, Video Hider, Digital Wellbeing, Download UI, Video Notes and
  Studio Comments. Not yet read with the same care: `features/dearrow`, `element-zapper`,
  `player-dock`, `return-dislike`, `search-hygiene`, `sponsorblock`, `subtitles`,
  `video-insights`, `live-chat`, `sticky-chat`, `subscription-view`, and `extension/core/*`
  beyond heatmap, chapters and settings-schema.
  Where: the modules above.
  Acceptance: each module read for lifecycle symmetry, late async work after destroy, outside
  text in templates and unbound guards, with findings fixed or logged here.
  Complexity: L
  Note (2026-10-10 research): fixes landed in `features/dearrow` (1ab5cdc0, 7705066b),
  `features/return-dislike` (54094a4f) and `features/player-dock` (b0f4565f) on 2026-10-09;
  confirm those three count as read before starting on the rest.
