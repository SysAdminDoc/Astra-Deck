# Roadmap — Astra Deck

## Research-Driven Additions

### P0 — Critical / Root-Cause

### P1 — Trust / Reliability / Distribution

(CWS submission, AMO submission, companion binary release moved to Roadmap_Blocked.md — require manual external actions.)

### P1 — Accessibility

### P2 — Quick Wins / Enhancement


(Competitor migration docs and supply chain transparency docs moved to Roadmap_Blocked.md — require creating new markdown files.)

### P2 — Observability / Developer Experience

(Visual regression testing moved to Roadmap_Blocked.md — requires headless browser environment.)

### P3 — Later / Under Consideration

- [ ] P3 — SharedAudio port to extension (MAIN world audio processing)
  Why: volumeBoost, skipSilence, audioNormalization, and audioEqualizer are userscript-only because they require MAIN world Web Audio API access. Tweaks for YouTube ships compressor, auto gain, and pan in-extension. The MAIN world bridge (`ytkit-main.js`) already exists for codec filtering.
  Evidence: CLAUDE.md "Not Yet Ported to Extension" section; Tweaks for YouTube features page lists advanced audio processing.
  Touches: `extension/ytkit-main.js` (MAIN world audio graph), `extension/ytkit.js` (data-attribute bridge), `extension/manifest.json`
  Acceptance: At least volumeBoost and audioNormalization work in the extension build via MAIN world bridge; feature toggles in settings panel.
  Complexity: XL



(Chrome Writer/Rewriter API moved to Roadmap_Blocked.md — API still in Developer Trial, not stable.)
