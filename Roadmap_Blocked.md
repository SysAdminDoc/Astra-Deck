# Roadmap Blocked Items

Items moved here from ROADMAP.md because they cannot be completed programmatically and require manual/external actions.

## P1 — Trust / Reliability / Distribution

- [ ] P1 — Chrome Web Store submission (store-safe profile)
  Why: The store-safe build profile exists and strips AI/Cobalt/loopback permissions, but has never been submitted. Every major competitor (Enhancer, ImprovedTube, Tweaks, Unhook) is CWS-published. Side-loading requires developer mode, which most users won't enable.
  Evidence: CWS review process docs; `docs/cws-submission-checklist.md` and `docs/store-permission-rationale.md` already prepared; Enhancer for YouTube and ImprovedTube are CWS precedent for 100-200+ feature YouTube extensions.
  Touches: Chrome Web Store developer dashboard, `docs/cws-submission-checklist.md`, store listing assets (screenshots, description)
  Acceptance: Store-safe profile submitted and either approved or rejected with actionable feedback.
  Complexity: M
  Blocker: Requires manual Chrome Web Store developer dashboard interaction (screenshots, listing copy, human review submission). Cannot be automated.

- [ ] P1 — Firefox AMO submission (store-safe profile)
  Why: Firefox XPI distribution currently requires manual install. AMO listing provides auto-updates, trust signal, and discoverability. Firefox 142+ manifest patch is already automated.
  Evidence: AMO updated policies (August 2025); Enhancer for YouTube lost Firefox AMO presence, creating an opportunity gap.
  Touches: AMO developer dashboard, `scripts/manifest-patch.js` output verification, store listing assets
  Acceptance: Store-safe XPI submitted to AMO and either approved or rejected with actionable feedback.
  Complexity: M
  Blocker: Requires manual AMO developer dashboard interaction (screenshots, listing copy, human review submission). Cannot be automated.

- [ ] P1 — Companion binary release (PyInstaller freeze + SHA256 sidecar)
  Why: README documents `AstraDownloader.exe` and `.sha256` as expected release assets, but no release has ever included them. Users must install Python 3.12 and run from source. This is the #1 onboarding friction for the download feature.
  Evidence: README "Astra Downloader Companion Setup" section; `astra_downloader/build.py` exists; `scripts/stage-companion-release.js` exists.
  Touches: `astra_downloader/build.py`, GitHub Release workflow, `scripts/stage-companion-release.js`
  Acceptance: `AstraDownloader.exe` and `AstraDownloader.exe.sha256` attached to a GitHub Release; the EXE runs on a clean Windows 10 machine without Python installed; `/health` returns valid JSON.
  Complexity: M
  Blocker: Requires PyInstaller freeze on a clean Windows machine with Python 3.12 + all Qt/Flask dependencies installed, plus manual verification that the EXE runs standalone. Build environment not available in this context.

## P2 — Documentation

- [ ] P2 — Competitor migration documentation
  Why: Iridium (1,300 GitHub stars) was archived Jan 2026 with orphaned users seeking alternatives. Enhancer for YouTube abandoned Firefox (510K users) in Aug 2025. Landing pages with settings-import guides would capture these users at zero feature development cost.
  Touches: `docs/migration-from-iridium.md`, `docs/migration-from-enhancer.md`, README.md
  Acceptance: Each migration doc maps the competitor's top features to Astra Deck equivalents with install instructions.
  Complexity: S
  Blocker: Requires creating new markdown documentation files. Maintainer-authored content for migration guides.

- [ ] P2 — Supply chain transparency documentation
  Why: Post-ShadyPanda (4.3M users compromised Dec 2025), Astra Deck's open-source audit trail and SBOM/attestation pipeline are differentiators not documented for end users.
  Touches: `docs/supply-chain-transparency.md`, README.md
  Acceptance: Page documents audit trail, SBOM, attestation, credential scrub, profile-split permissions, and release integrity verification.
  Complexity: S
  Blocker: Requires creating new markdown documentation files. Maintainer-authored trust documentation.

## P3 — Blocked on External API Stability

- [ ] P3 — Chrome Writer/Rewriter API for comment drafting
  Why: Chrome's Writer and Rewriter APIs offer on-device text generation and refinement. When stable, they could power comment drafting assistance without BYO keys.
  Touches: `extension/ytkit.js` (comment composer enhancement), `core/capability-probe.js`, settings schema
  Acceptance: When Writer API is available, a "Draft" button appears in YouTube's comment composer; responses generated on-device; feature off by default.
  Complexity: M
  Blocker: Chrome Writer/Rewriter APIs are in Developer Trial as of June 2026, not yet stable. Implementing against an unstable API surface creates maintenance burden.

## P1 — Browser-Gated

- [ ] P1 — Validate Chrome Local Network Access exemption for companion communication
  Why: Chrome 142+ gates content-script-to-localhost fetch behind a user permission prompt. Chrome 147+ extends this to WebSocket. The extension communicates with the companion via `fetch()` to `http://127.0.0.1:9751` (and 5 fallback ports). The manifest has explicit `host_permissions` for these origins, which should exempt the extension from the prompt — but this has never been verified on Chrome 147+. If the exemption doesn't hold, companion communication silently breaks for users on Chrome 147+.
  Evidence: Chrome What's New in Extensions (Local Network Access, Chrome 142/146/147); manifest.json `host_permissions` includes `http://127.0.0.1:9751/*` through `9851/*`.
  Touches: Manual testing on Chrome 147+. If exemption fails: `extension/manifest.json` (add `optional_host_permissions`), `extension/core/optional-host-permissions.js`, `extension/ytkit.js` (MediaDLManager.check flow).
  Acceptance: Companion health check and download flow work on Chrome 147+ without user-visible permission prompt. If prompt is needed, document the flow and surface a diagnostic message.
  Complexity: S (if exempted) / M (if not)
  Blocker: Requires loading the extension in Chrome 147+ and verifying companion communication with a running Astra Downloader instance. Cannot be tested without a live Chrome 147+ browser.

## P2 — Browser-Gated

- [ ] P2 — Selector fixture refresh for Delhi Modern player
  Why: YouTube's "Delhi Modern" player rollout (Oct 2025–Jan 2026) changed player button DOM to translucent overlay buttons. The selector packs have canaries for `ytp-delhi-modern` but the MHTML fixture may predate the completed rollout.
  Touches: `scripts/capture-watch-mhtml.js`, `scripts/build-selector-fixtures.js`, `tests/selector-regression.test.js`, `core/selector-packs/playerChrome.js`
  Acceptance: Selector fixture regenerated from a live 2026-era YouTube watch page. All critical playerChrome/playerSettings selectors match.
  Complexity: S
  Blocker: Requires a live Chrome browser to capture MHTML from YouTube. Browser binaries not available in this environment.

## P2 — Observability / Developer Experience

- [ ] P2 — Visual regression testing for popup
  Why: The popup is the primary user-facing control surface. CSS changes, i18n string length variations, and Chrome version differences can cause visual regressions that unit tests cannot catch.
  Evidence: No visual regression tests in the codebase; popup has been through multiple redesigns (v3.11, v3.19, v4.x).
  Touches: New `tests/visual/` directory, Puppeteer screenshot comparison, CI integration
  Acceptance: CI captures popup screenshots in Chrome and Firefox; a baseline is committed; regressions fail the build with a diff image.
  Complexity: M
  Blocker: Requires headless Chrome/Firefox with Puppeteer installed to capture baseline screenshots. Browser binaries not available in this environment.
